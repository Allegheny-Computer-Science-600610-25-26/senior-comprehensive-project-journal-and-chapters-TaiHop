To very blunt, I feel like there were times near the start I felt like there was communication but very delayed, miscommunication. As In 2 different professors would tell me things arent gonna be due then end up being due. 

However, I feel like it was good class with a good learning environment, better communication however would have helped me get a grasp of what needs to be done by when. It was also helpful to talk with other students to inspire new ideas that you could implement int your work.
