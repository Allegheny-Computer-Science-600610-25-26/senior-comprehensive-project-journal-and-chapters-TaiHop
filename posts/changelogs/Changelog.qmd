After a while of of working i have come up to my version 1.0.0 of my thesis. As I writing this right now  I have just got to upload my newest version to github.

For my introduction and related works section, I feel like i came in thinking of not writing much but as the weeks progressed i really found myself in a place where I wish i did more from the beginning.

I had to basiaclly rewrite my introduction because I left little direction to go in with minimal writing. Moving foward I will work a bit differently with my time. For related works it was a little different as I now had direction, i just had to add some more information. a list of more impactful changes are:

Lenghth
citations
visualizations
broader coverage for all aspects
