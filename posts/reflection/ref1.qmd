The current state of my project is the parsing of the pac website and the scrapine/storing of information of the data and then i have a search function. As of now its a manual interaction and not all players are scraped because certain players are listed on the charts for individual stats. Moving foward I will be working on automation of the manual steps and also finding a way to scrape all players from the site
