My experiences preparing and giving my presentation were a little rushed. I felt like leading up to the presentation ,
I was scammering around to make sure I had everything done. Giving the presentation I felt very confident and proud of the work i had done 
and was presenting to the class but I was also a little nervous that what i had done wasnt enough.
