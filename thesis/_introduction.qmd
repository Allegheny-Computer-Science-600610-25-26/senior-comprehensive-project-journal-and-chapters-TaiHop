# Introduction

Opportunities in both sports and life are often lost due to timing being in the right place at the right moment and this concept is particularly evident in the world of athletics. Many athletes who strive to advance their careers are overlooked not because of a lack of talent or effort, but because of limited exposure and systemic inefficiencies in the scouting and recruitment process. Those who do not reach their desired level of success frequently cite insufficient exposure as a major factor, a claim that may seem like an excuse to those unfamiliar with the realities of competitive sports. However, this issue is genuine and pervasive, as coaches and scouts often operate under time constraints and institutional pressure to make rapid decisions, leading them to focus on a narrow pool of athletes while unintentionally disregarding others who may possess equal or greater potential. Factors as minor as a delayed highlight reel, a scheduling conflict, or a missed opportunity to perform at a key event can significantly diminish an athlete’s chances of being noticed. To address this inequity, I propose the development of a player search engine designed to make the recruitment process/transfer portal more transparent, efficient, and inclusive. This technology would allow coaches, scouts, and teams to easily access and compare player statistics by simply searching for an athlete’s name. Utilizing data from the Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) website as an initial source, the system would centralize athletic information, reducing the impact of timing and chance in talent identification. Ultimately, this project aims to create a more equitable landscape for aspiring athletes by ensuring that visibility and opportunity are determined by performance and data accessibility rather than circumstance or coincidence.
The issue of timing and exposure in sports is not only a personal challenge for individual athletes but also a larger problem within the entire athletic recruitment system. In recent years, technology has begun to change how athletes are discovered and evaluated, with new digital platforms helping connect players, coaches, and scouts more efficiently. Despite these advances, many athletes—especially those from smaller schools or less-publicized programs—still struggle to gain the visibility they deserve. This ongoing imbalance shows the need for more accessible and transparent systems that make it easier for all athletes to be recognized based on their skills and performance rather than their circumstances or exposure level.
Although several companies have made progress in improving athlete exposure and recruitment, important gaps remain that my proposed player search engine seeks to fill. Platforms such as Haystack Sports, StadiumPrime, and Hudl allow athletes to share videos and connect with coaches, while organizations like NextGen Prospect and LBi Software provide data analytics and management tools for teams. New developments in artificial intelligence and data tracking have also improved how player performance is analyzed, marking the state of the art in sports technology. However, most of these systems focus on highly visible programs, leaving many talented athletes from smaller conferences underrepresented. My project aims to close this gap by using data from the Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) to create a searchable, centralized database of athlete statistics. This platform would make it easier for coaches and scouts to find skilled players who might otherwise go unnoticed, while offering real-time updates, simple navigation, and fair access to information. In doing so, it extends current technologies toward a more inclusive and data-driven approach to sports recruitment.
	While the goal of the player search engine is to create fairer opportunities for athletes, there are several ethical issues that must be considered. Privacy is an important concern, as the system would collect and share athlete information, so data should only come from public or approved sources with athlete consent. Accuracy is also essential, since incorrect or outdated statistics could harm an athlete’s chances, meaning data must be verified and regularly updated. There is also a risk of bias if the search features or algorithms unintentionally favor certain schools, positions, or backgrounds. To reduce this, the system should use diverse data and transparent methods. Additionally, steps must be taken to prevent misuse of information, such as unauthorized access or data scraping. Finally, to avoid creating new inequalities, the platform should be accessible to athletes from all backgrounds and schools. By focusing on privacy, fairness, and responsible data use, this project can help ensure that technology supports equality and opportunity in sports recruitment.
	My overall aim for this project is a well designed web interface that welcomes people and makes people want to return. I want players and coaches to use my tool to better themselves and their team. Ultimately I want people to get the opportunities they work so hard to get, to create a sense of fairness in a world that is set to be unfair
