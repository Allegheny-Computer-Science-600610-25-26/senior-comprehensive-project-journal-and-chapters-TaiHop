# Introduction

Opportunities in both sports and life are often shaped by timing, circumstance, and being in the right place at the right moment. This reality is especially evident in athletics, where the difference between advancing and being overlooked frequently comes down to visibility rather than ability. Many athletes fail to reach their desired level of success not because they lack talent or effort, but because systemic inefficiencies in the scouting and recruitment process limit their exposure. Although some may dismiss this as an excuse, the issue is well documented and deeply ingrained in competitive sports environments. Coaches and scouts operate under significant time pressure, often making rapid decisions with incomplete information and consequently focusing on a narrow set of athletes who happen to be accessible at a specific moment. Even minor factors such as a delayed highlight video, a scheduling conflict, or missing a single showcase event can dramatically diminish an athlete’s opportunities. These systemic constraints echo the broader challenges discussed in sports analytics, where data availability and timing heavily influence evaluation outcomes (Stavros et al., 2022).

To address these inequities, I propose the development of a player search engine designed to make recruitment and transfer portal processes more transparent, efficient, and inclusive. My idea is to scrape the PAC website and then store this data for transformations. This stored data will be output into multiple csv files, this is to create an opportunity for other companies to step in and make their own changes and with a csv it is very easy to manage if another company were to come in and use the information output. However for my personal use, I have the data being put into a sqlite database and then that database is what the search engine will actually search through; so in turn the output would be whoever you searched up stats along with a graph to show up giving a visualization to a players stats and give insight into their projectability. All these steps thrown together make a workflow that looks like this: call tool → PAC → csv/sqlite db → searchable player → stats and data visualization. This idea aligns with the growing role of data science in sports, which has already transformed performance optimization, predictive modeling, and fan engagement. Data driven systems have proven valuable in identifying patterns that humans alone might overlook, whether in player performance, injury prediction, or fan behavior (Su et al., 2022; Previati, 2020). Extending these same principles to athlete discovery can help reduce the influence of chance by centralizing performance information into a system that is easily searchable and accessible. Using publicly available data from the Presidents Athletic Conference as the initial dataset, the proposed platform would allow coaches, scouts, and teams to locate and compare player statistics instantly. By consolidating information that is currently scattered across institutional websites and media outlets, the system would reduce dependence on timing and personal networks, thereby giving athletes a better chance to be evaluated based on their true performance.

The broader issue of exposure is not simply an individual challenge but a structural problem within the athletic recruitment ecosystem. Even as technology has improved how players are evaluated, many athletes remain invisible because they are part of smaller or less publicized programs. This digital divide mirrors the disparities that appear in the application of sports analytics more generally. For instance, advanced biometrics, machine learning tools, and real time performance systems are widely available to elite programs but less commonly adopted by smaller institutions (Cossich et al., 2023; Jayanthi et al., 2022). As a result, athletes with significant potential may continue to be overshadowed due to factors unrelated to their abilities. The persistence of this imbalance demonstrates the need for more inclusive technologies that expand visibility and standardize access to information.

Although companies such as Haystack Sports, StadiumPrime, and Hudl have advanced the landscape of digital recruitment, important gaps remain. Current platforms tend to favor athletes who already have access to strong media support or who play in highly visible conferences. In contrast, organizations like NextGen Prospect and LBi Software primarily serve larger teams with sophisticated analytics infrastructures. This reinforces the pattern seen across modern sports analytics: technology drives improvement, but access is uneven (GÜLAY, 2023; Bitrián et al., 2021). The proposed player search engine aims to close this gap by creating a centralized, neutral data hub for athletes in smaller conferences. Such a system would provide real time updates, intuitive navigation, and equal access across programs, reflecting the same principles of accessibility and personalization seen in modern fan engagement technologies (Teixeira et al., 2023; Chan Olmsted, 2019).

However, the development of this system must incorporate strong ethical considerations. Privacy is a major concern, particularly since the platform would handle personal and performance related athlete data. As seen in broader discussions of data collection in sports, the use of biometric or personal information requires strong protections and clear consent (Impellizzeri et al., 2020; Tanisawa et al., 2020). Ensuring accuracy is equally essential, as incorrect data could directly harm an athlete’s opportunities. Algorithmic bias also presents a risk; search features might unintentionally favor certain schools, positions, or demographic backgrounds, mirroring the concerns about bias found in sports analytics and explainable artificial intelligence (Lai et al., 2021; Tursunbayeva et al., 2022). To prevent these issues, the platform should rely on diverse data sources, transparent design principles, and strict access controls. Additionally, it must be usable by athletes across socioeconomic backgrounds to avoid reinforcing existing inequalities.

Ultimately, my vision for this project is a welcoming, well designed web interface that encourages long term use by both players and coaches. More importantly, it strives to create a sense of fairness in a landscape that has historically been shaped by chance, timing, and unequal access to exposure. By grounding this system in the same technological principles that have modernized performance analytics, injury prediction, and fan engagement, the project aims to ensure that future opportunities in sport are determined by merit and accessible information rather than circumstance. In a world that is often structurally unfair, this tool seeks to create a pathway where hard work and data backed performance can finally speak louder than luck.
