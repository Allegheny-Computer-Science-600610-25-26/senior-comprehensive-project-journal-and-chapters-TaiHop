Research on athlete evaluation consistently shows that structural barriers in recruitment shape which athletes receive meaningful exposure, particularly those outside large or well-funded programs. Visibility is often driven by institutional prestige, geography, and media presence rather than strictly by performance, creating inequities that persist even as digital technologies expand access to information. Certain papers actually note that coaches frequently rely on fragmented or context-dependent data, and the timing of when information becomes available can influence evaluation outcomes as much as the underlying performance itself (Lemez & Baker, 2015; García-Rubio et al., 2019). These dynamics reinforce the need for centralized, standardized data systems that reduce dependence on chance, personal networks, and inconsistent reporting practices. Which is why I am creating my tool to give these people more chances. People at lower divisions are often overlooked because how easy it is to find players at higher division schools, because at certain schools and their athletics site is very underdeveloped compared to those who have more money to put into that such as sites that contain Big 12 schools or SEC schools, schools that have a very high influence over the media that can bring in more money than a lower division school ever could. My tool is to bring lower division school exposure up to make up for that difference.

Although digital recruitment platforms such as Hudl and FieldLevel have modernized aspects of athlete promotion, research shows that these systems often replicate existing inequalities rather than eliminate them. Athletes with access to high quality video production, well supported programs, or strong social media visibility are more likely to benefit, while those from smaller conferences remain underrepresented (Hutchins & Rowe, 2012; Billings et al., 2020). Because many of these platforms emphasize multimedia over structured, comparable quantitative data, coaches and scouts may still struggle to objectively evaluate athletes across different institutions. This gap highlights the value of tools designed to consolidate reliable statistical information in a format that enables direct comparison. Platforms such as hudl have made a lot of headway but as stated above those platforms are often unequal almost by nature and not by intention. I feel like my tool will give results and projectability of players a more equal playing field. I say this because I will not have video, so certain aspects will not be able to make people stand out, only the data will. Which is why it should be let the stats pave the way. Although they won't stand out , players will be able to see how their stats have been trending as of recently and make decisions based on what they see. This allows coaches to see players for who they are instead of seeing a highlight from a division 1 school taking up the front page of these major platforms. Therefore creating an equal playing ground that promotes player growth and opportunities.

Recent developments in sports analytics demonstrate that automated data collection, web scraping, and structured database systems are increasingly central to modern athletic analysis. To think of this, if there are more of the same output like a file that is easy to integrate into work, if everyone had that or most people used the same thing , many more things would become accessible. Things such as bigger projects, being able to compare different results easier. Multiple projects and researchers have shown that integrating data from online sources improves accessibility and allows for more advanced analytical techniques(Fuchs et al., 2021). Machine learning applications in sports further rely on well organized pipelines consisting of data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and storage approaches that align closely with the workflow behind a dedicated search engine for athlete discovery (Su et al., 2020; Previati & Casalino, 2020). These pipelines that can be used for other people and different manipulations to data is why my tool also gives a csv in the output to let others also take control in their own way, thus letting my model and tool be involved in more major projects. These csv files could be used by virtually anyone as csv files are very easy to change, add to a database, and to also create graphics.

The growing influence of data-driven decision-making in sports offers additional support for centralized platforms that combine searchability with visual analytics. Studies show that statistical modeling and performance visualization enhance everything from player comparison to talent forecasting, making it easier for coaches to identify trends that might otherwise remain hidden (Brechot & Flepp, 2021; Perin et al., 2018). Tools that integrate visualizations with player statistics such as graphs of game-by-game or season-wide performance fit squarely within this trajectory of sports analytics research, which prioritizes both accuracy, interpretability and reliability Despite these advances, inequities in the adoption of sports technology remain a significant concern. High-budget programs continue to use advanced tracking systems, wearables, and real-time analytics at much higher rates than smaller institutions, contributing to persistent disparities in athlete visibility and evaluation quality (Rossi et al., 2022). Studies of digital divides in sports note that programs with fewer resources often cannot fully benefit from modern analytics, resulting in underexposure for their athletes even when they perform at a high level (Cossich et al., 2021). These findings underscore the need for accessible, low-cost tools that democratize access to performance data, ensuring that more athletes can be evaluated on merit.

Design research in digital sports platforms further emphasizes the importance of accessibility, personalization, and intuitive user experience. As sports organizations increasingly rely on digital systems for communication and engagement, scholars argue that platforms must serve diverse user groups and reduce barriers to information access (Teixeira & Lima, 2022; Chan-Olmsted, 2019). User-friendly interfaces not only increase engagement but also help counteract structural inequalities by making critical information visible to coaches, athletes, and evaluators who may not have access to advanced analytics infrastructure. These principles directly support the development of a transparent, searchable player database designed to broaden opportunity in an ecosystem where exposure is often unevenly distributed to all who inhibit it. Tools like Tai’s Checker will be the answer to these issues .
